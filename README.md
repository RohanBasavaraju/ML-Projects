# Project Template: Machine Learning for Predictive Modeling (with Python)


1) Define Problem

The key is to first identify a real-world problem that is challenging to solve without empirical evidence/data (e.g. classifying different types of plants/rocks, predicting urban housing markets, etc). This problem will ideally have a significant impact on your life, and you solving this problem with machine learning should be extremely helpful to this task. In turn, when you encounter this problem in the future, you should be able to provide a reliable and accurate solution.

After the problem has been identified, the next step is to locate and store datasets of past instances of the problem at hand. A common and simple way of storing datasets is by using a CSV file. Next, you must find and install the software tools required to model your dataset via for making predictions. In my projects, I use the Python programming language and its Scikit-learn, SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries. Afterwards, create a code file in your IDE of choice (e.g. Atom), and place your project in a folder that includes the file and your dataset. In the code file, import the libraries and load the dataset that you will be using.

2) Summarize Data

Now that you have set up our machine learning project, you are ready to dive deep into the data! Before you can build your machine learning models, you must first understand the data that you will be using for your problem. The two key ways of summarizing your data are through descriptive statistics and data visualizations.



3) Prepare Data

4) Evaluate Algorithms

5) Improve Accuracy

6) Finalize Model

7) Present Results

Congratulations! You are have now completed your very own machine learning project! There are a number of ways that you can share with the world what you've accomplished and learned through your project. One scalable method of sharing machine learning projects on the internet is by uploading your project's code file along with a description of the project to GitHub. From there, you can make your project publicly available, so anyone can view your project's summary and details and learn how you went through solving your problem with machine learning. Best of luck!
